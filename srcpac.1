.SH "NAME"
srcpac \- A bash build wrapper for pacman.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsrcpac\fR <operation> [options] [package] ...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsrcpac\fR is a wrapper for pacman. It allows for automatic building of specified packages from source. The built package is then installed via pacman. If you never tell srcpac to build anything from source, it will act just like pacman.
.SH "OPERATIONS"
For additional OPERATIONS not specified below, see pacman manpage. Only those OPERATIONS specified below have been modified.

.TP 
\fB\-R, \-\-remove\fR
Remove a package from the system. Works the same as \fBpacman\fR. In addition, the 'from\-source' marking will be removed.

.TP 
\fB\-Q, \-\-query\fR
Query the package database. Works the same as \fBpacman\fR. Additionally, use of the \fB\-i\fR option tells you whether a package is marked as 'from\-source' or not. 

.TP 
\fB\-S, \-\-sync\fR
Synchronize packages. Works the same as \fBpacman\fR. Additional flags may be specified to build something from source (see below). 

.TP 
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Display syntax for the given operation. If no operation was supplied then the general syntax is shown.
.SH "OPTIONS"
See pacman manpage. No additional general options beyond what pacman provides. See specific section below for added options specific to the operation.
.SH "SYNC OPTIONS"
For additional SYNC options not specified below, see pacman manpage. Only those options specified below have been modified.

.TP 
\fB\-b\fR
.br 
Build specified package from source. This runs \fBmakepkg\fR in your abs tree. This may build an older version of the package if the abs tree is not updated.

.TP 
\fB\-y\fR
.br 
This command updates the abs tree and the pacman database.
.TP 
\fB\-o\fR
.br 
Applies the sed command to a PKGBUILD (see CONFIGURATION), then pipes the output to less. This allows you to make sure the changes are applied properly. No actual build occurs when using \fB\-o\fR.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
\fBsrcpac\fR lets you specify custom configs based on sed commands applied to PKGBUILDs. The config file is \fI/etc/srcpac.conf\fR. 

You specify a bash variable in the config file, which is a set of sed substitutes. All configs have \fBconf_\fR prepended to them.

.TP 
\fBExample:\fR
conf_gaim=('#./configure \-\-prefix#./configure \-\-with\-gtkspell \-\-prefix#'
"#depends=('startup\-notification'#depends=(gtkspell 'startup\-notification'#")

.TP 
Every element in the above example \fBconf_\fR statement is supplied to the PKGBUILD in a big sed command like this:
sed \-i "s<string1>;s<string2>;[...]" PKGBUILD

.TP 
So the command above, combined with the \fBconf_\fR directive, yeilds:
sed \-i "'s#./configure \-\-prefix#./configure \-\-with\-gtkspell
\-\-prefix#';s#depends=('startup\-notification'#depends=(gtkspell'startup\-notification'#;" PKGBUILD

.TP 
Since writing these rules can be kind of tricky, it is best to use the \fB\-o\fR flag (see above) until you are sure things look right.
.SH "CONFIGURATION CAVEATS"
You cannot have bash variables that have hyphens in them, so package names with hyphens are replaced with X's. 

For example, the package 'foo\-bar' would be \fBconf_fooXbar\fR.
